        <h1>Getting to Know About Naawi Oodena</h1>
        <p>
          Naawi Oodena, meaning "centre of the heart and community" in
          Anishinaabemowin, is a vital initiative led by Treaty 1 First Nations.
          Located on the site of the former Kapyong Barracks in Winnipeg,
          Manitoba, it represents a significant reclamation of Indigenous land
          and a step toward economic self-sufficiency and cultural
          revitalization. The project is deeply rooted in the preservation of
          Indigenous identity, language, and governance, serving as both a
          living space and a cultural hub for generations to come.

        <h1>What Is Naawi Oodena Including?</h1>
        <p>
          Naawi-Oodena includes one of the largest urban reserves in Canada. The
          development plan features residential housing for Indigenous families,
          business zones that encourage First Nations entrepreneurship, cultural
          centers for ceremonies and learning, healthcare and educational
          institutions, and preserved green spaces to honor the land’s original
          ecology. The site is intentionally designed to blend modern
          infrastructure with traditional values, creating a holistic and
          welcoming environment for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

        <h1>Timeline of Naawi Oodena</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>2004:</strong> The Canadian military vacates the Kapyong
          Barracks, leaving a large, unused area in Winnipeg. <br />
          <strong>2005–2015:</strong> Treaty 1 First Nations legally challenge
          the federal government's plan to transfer the land without
          consultation. <br />
          <strong>2015:</strong> The courts affirm that the federal government
          has a duty to consult with First Nations on land transfers. <br />
          <strong>2019:</strong> An agreement is reached, and the land is
          officially transferred to Treaty 1 First Nations. <br />
          <strong>2022:</strong> The site is named “Naawi-Oodena,” symbolizing
          unity and cultural resurgence. <br />
          <strong>2023–2035:</strong> Phased development includes
          infrastructure, homes, cultural centers, and community services.
          <br />
          <strong>2035–Present:</strong> Naawi-Oodena becomes a thriving urban
          Indigenous community and a model for reconciliation across Canada.
